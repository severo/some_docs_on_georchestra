# Technologies used in geOrchestra

Here are some notes, but I think it deserves a dedicated documentation in every
module of geOrchestra, describing the technologies used, the dependencies to
other software (other geOrchestra modules, submodules, or external software).

## General technologies

- Java - currently with the version 8
- [Spring Web MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html)


# To Do

- explain when and why we use the XML Spring configuration, and when it's done in Java
- explain how the properties / variables / configurations are managed
- explain how the different modules manage the cache
